## Overview

To support a more expansive usage of the Git object database — as is the goal for other projects within the [`git-ents`](https://github.com/git-ents) organization — new tooling is needed.
This project provides a command that allows users to associate arbitrary data to any object in Git's store.
The `metadata` command follows `notes` semantics.

[Notes] are a tragically underutilized feature of Git.
For more information about `git notes` entries, Tyler Cipriani's [blog post] is an excellent introduction, and some highly-motivating examples.
One such example is Google's open-source [`git-appraise`] project, which stores code review metadata as structured entries in a note blob.
While impressive, that design highlights a limitation of notes: structured data, or data that does not map cleanly onto UTF-8 text, is difficult to represent in a blob format.
The `git-metadata` project provides a structured alternative to the notes-blob design using Git trees objects.
Just like notes, metadata added to an object does not alter the object's history.

> [!TIP]
> Unlike notes, `metadata` is not added to `git log`.

## Usage

Metadata entries are paths (with optional blob content) stored in a Git tree object, associated with any target object (blob, tree, or commit) via a fanout ref.
The command follows `git notes` semantics: `list`, `show`, `add`, `remove`, `copy`, `prune`, and `get-ref`.

<!-- rumdl-disable MD013 -->

```shell
# Add a path entry to HEAD's metadata tree
git metadata add labels/bug
git metadata add review/status -m approved

# Add metadata to a specific object
git metadata add labels/urgent abc1234

# Show all metadata entries for an object
git metadata show          # defaults to HEAD
git metadata show abc1234

# List all targets that have metadata
git metadata list

# Remove entries by glob pattern
git metadata remove 'labels/*'
git metadata remove 'labels/bug' -o abc1234

# Keep only matching entries (remove everything else)
git metadata remove --keep 'review/**'

# Copy metadata from one object to another
git metadata copy abc1234 def5678

# Remove metadata for objects that no longer exist
git metadata prune
git metadata prune -n  # dry run

# Print the metadata ref name
git metadata get-ref

# Create a bidirectional link between two keys
git metadata link issue:42 commit:abc1234 --forward closes --reverse closed-by

# Remove a bidirectional link
git metadata unlink issue:42 commit:abc1234 --forward closes --reverse closed-by

# List all links for a key
git metadata linked issue:42

# List links filtered by relation
git metadata linked issue:42 --relation closes

# Use a custom ref
git metadata --ref refs/metadata/custom add labels/bug
```

```shell
git metadata -h
```

### Library

The `git-metadata` library can be added to your Rust project via `cargo add`.

```shell
cargo add git-metadata
```
